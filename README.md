# 1 - Feedback widget
Create an app to collect statistics. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

# STEP 1.
The application should display the number of collected reviews for each category. The app should not store feedback statistics between different sessions (page refresh).

# STEP 2.
Expand the functionality of the application so that the interface displays more statistics about the collected reviews. Add the display of the total number of collected feedback from all categories and the percentage of positive feedback. 

# STEP 3.
Refactor the application. The application state should remain in the root <App> component.

# STEP 4.
Expand the functionality of the application so that the statistics block is rendered only after at least one feedback has been collected. Put the message about the lack of statistics in the <Notification message="There is no feedback"> component.
